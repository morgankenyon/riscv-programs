# Risc-v Programs

This repo will contain simple programs that I write in riscv assembly. Not sure where it will end up going, but just playing around for now.

## Running on Ubuntu

I have a make file that uses the qemu toolchain, if you can't run that binary (get errors), you can run the following command.

```
qemu-riscv64 ./hello
```
